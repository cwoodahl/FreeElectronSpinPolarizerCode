# FreeElectronSpinPolarizerCode
The included matlab files produce implement the Pauli equation with specific assumptions, create figures and performing calculations of free electron wavefunctions after interaction with a phase-matched near field.

'SpinExpectation' implements a Pauli Equation for a two stage interaction, where you can specify the interaction strengths and phases. As well as drift length between the two interaction stages.

'PauliSplitStep' implements an interaction including ponderomotive and diffractive effects in a second stage where the input electron wavefunction is assumed to be that resulting from a single stage interaction of SpinExpectation2.m.
